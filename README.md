## Variables

* Naming convention is camel case with the variable starting with a letter. 

**Why?**

> When you are scanning the code your eye catches the variables more easily.

```
let camelCase = 45
 
const variableName = "Wo King"
```

* let, const will be used as much as possible to declare variables

**Why?**

> It helps keep the variables in scope

```
let banana = true

const apple = 43
```

## Code Styling

* Semicolans ; will not be at the end of commands

**Why?**

> Because Willem said so, that's why.

```
So commands are like this

Not like this;
```
